**FreeriderHD Track Downloader** is a streamlined Flask web application designed to help FreeRiderHD players retrieve track data quickly and efficiently. With this tool, users can input a track URL from FreeRiderHD, and the app will automatically extract and display the unique track code.

**How It Works**

1. User Input: The app interface accepts a FreeRiderHD track URL from the user.
   
2. Track Number Extraction: The app uses a regular expression to isolate the track number from the URL, an essential part of constructing a data link to FreeRiderHDâ€™s servers.
   
3. Data Retrieval: Using the extracted track number, the app generates a URL and sends an HTTP request to FreeRiderHD to fetch the track data in JSON format.
   
4. Error Handling: If the URL is invalid or data cannot be retrieved, the app provides user-friendly error messages.
   
5. Display and Copy: The app extracts the track code from the fetched data and displays it to the user, who can then easily copy it to their clipboard.
   
**Key Functions**

1. index(): Displays the main page with an input field for the track URL.
   
2. fetch_data(): Handles the URL processing and data retrieval. This function: Extracts the track number from the URL. Constructs and fetches data from the FreeRiderHD server.Parses the response, isolating the code field, and returns it for display.

3. find_available_port(start_port, max_port): Ensures the app finds an available port to run, incrementing until it finds an open one.
